## About This Organization

This GitHub organization is maintained by [Alaska Software](https://www.alaska-software.com) and serves as the public home for **Xbase++ sample applications, technology demonstrations, and community resources**. Whether you are a seasoned Xbase++ developer or just getting started, these repositories provide practical, runnable examples that showcase the capabilities of the Xbase++ platform.

## What is Xbase++?

Xbase++ is a professional development platform for 32-bit and 64-bit Windows applications created by Alaska Software. It combines a **native code compiler**, an object-oriented programming model, and a powerful runtime with full backward compatibility to Clipper and Visual FoxPro.

Key highlights of the platform include:

- **Hybrid Language** — procedural and object-oriented programming in a single, unified language
- **Native Code Compiler** — compiles to native Windows executables for maximum performance
- **Exchangeable DatabaseEngines** — transparent access to DBF/NTX, DBF/CDX, FPT/CDX (Visual FoxPro), PostgreSQL, Advantage Database Server, and SQLite
- **PostgreSQL ISAM (PGDBE)** — migrate flat-file applications to PostgreSQL without code changes
- **Intelligent Multithreading** — automatic, easy-to-use multithreading built into the runtime
- **Hybrid UI** — desktop GUI, web UI (CXP — Compiled Xbase Pages), console, graphics, touch & multi-touch
- **Web Application Platform** — build and deploy web applications using familiar Xbase++ skills with CXP and WebSockets
- **Full Clipper & partial FoxPro Compatibility** — recompile existing Clipper 87/5.x or FoxPro/VFP source code and modernize step by step
